This is a sample purchase order document that demonstrates the expected format
for PDF parsing. The parser will extract the following structured data:

- PO Number: A unique identifier for the purchase order
- Vendor: The supplier/vendor name
- Item: Description of the item being purchased
- Quantity: Number of items
- Unit Price: Price per item
- Total: Total amount for the line item
- Date: Purchase order date

The PDF parser is designed to handle variations in formatting while extracting
these key fields reliably.
